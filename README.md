# Single Notebook Projects
In this repository, I shall upload the single notebook projects that I will learn in my learning career graph. This readme contains the learning outcome and useful resources for each project.

## [1] Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Quora Insincere Questions Classification-with-TensorFlow


In this guided project I have learnt -
1. How to efficiently handle data and create input pipelines with td.data for bert models.
2. Tokenize and Preprocess Text for BERT using bert tokenizer.
3. Fine-tune BERT for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TF Hub.

Some useful resources to learn about bert and transformers:

1. The Illustrated Transformer (Jay Alammar)[https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/]

2. The Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and co. (How NLP Cracked Transfer Learning)[https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/]

3. The Annotated Transformer (Harvard NLP)[https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html]

4. For more advanced learners, here's the original BERT paper: (BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805]
